// problem statement :-

Arvind and suchi were solving the classical FizzBuzz Problem where in the given range of number from 1 to n if the
number is divisible by 3 print Fizz , if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz and if the number is divisible by 
both 3 and 5 then print FizzBuzz. Now shree came in the room and to test their knowledge of programming he  asked them do a modified FizzBuzz problem instead.
In this modified FizzBuzz Problem if any digit of the number is 3 print Fizz and  if any digit is 5 then print Buzz.
Help suchi and arvind writing a program for this problem.

for example : n=15
output:-
  1
  2
  Fizz
  4
  Buzz
  6
  7
  8
  9
  10
  11
  12
  Fizz 
  13
  14
  Buzz
  
Explanation :- In place of 3 we printed Fizz as this contains a digit 3, in place of 5 we printed Buzz as this contains a digit 5,
  in place of 13 we printed Fizz because it contains a digit 3 and similary in place of 15 we printed buzz as it contains a digit 5.
    
    
    
Input format: Input contains a single integer n 
Ouput Format : In the range of 1 to n print fizz if number contains a digit 3 and print buzz if it contains a digit 5 and if none then print the number itself
