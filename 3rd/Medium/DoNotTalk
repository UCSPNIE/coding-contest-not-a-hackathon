### 3rd year difficulty level: medium

Yathin is a good but strict lecturer. He has 'n' students in his class. Due to his popularity many students enrol in his course, there is not enough space in the class room, so students sit in a long hallway in a linear fashion.
One day Yathin was late to class. As a result, some of the students have formed pairs and are talking to each other, while the others are busy studying. 
This information is given to you by a string s of length n, consisting of characters '!', <' and '>', where '!' denotes that the student is studying, '>' denotes that the corresponding student is talking to the student to the right, and '<' denotes that the corresponding student is talking to the student to the left.
For example, consider a sample configuration of students - !><!. Here students numbered 1 and 4 are busy studying, while the student 2 and 3 are talking to each other. In this example, ><><, student 1 and 2 are talking to each other, and 3 and 4 are also talking to each other.
When the students see their teacher coming, those who were talking get afraid and immediately turn around, i.e. students talking to left have now turned to the right, and the one talking to right have turned to the left. When Yathin sees two students facing each other, he will assume that they were talking. A student who is busy studying will continue doing so. Yathin will call each pair of students who were talking and punish them. 
Can you find out how many pairs of students will get punished?

#Input
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of the test cases.(1<T<11)
Each test case contains a string 's' denoting the activities of students before students see Yathin entering the class.(1<s<100000)

#Output
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of pairs of students that will be punished.
